# Crazy Quilts

An example responsive images page whipped up for [<cite>Responsive Images in Practice</cite>](http://alistapart.com/article/responsive-images-in-practice), published in [<cite>A List Apart</cite> issue #407](http://alistapart.com/issue/407).

The article starts with [`status-quo.html`](http://alistapart.com/d/407/demo/status-quo.html), and responsifies it in three passes:

1. [`first-pass.html`](http://alistapart.com/d/407/demo/first-pass.html): Adding `srcset` and `sizes`
2. [`second-pass.html`](http://alistapart.com/d/407/demo/second-pass.html): Art directing with `<picture>` and `<source media>`
3. [`third-pass.html`](http://alistapart.com/d/407/demo/third-pass.html): Providing alternate formats (in this case, WebP) with `<picture>` and `<source type>`
